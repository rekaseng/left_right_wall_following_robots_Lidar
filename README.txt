Lab Assessment 1, LA-1 (15%)
----------------------------

This assessment is to evaluate performance for CLO2, to gauge
basic ability to program a (simulated) robot.

CLO2: Construct robotics & automation programming for
      practical uses. (P4, PLO2, LOD C3A)

==============================================================
TASK: construct a simulation that have TWO (2) robots running
simultaneously, one robot display a LEFT wall-following
behavior and another one robot have a RIGHT wall-following
behavior. Use LiDAR sensors as input for the robots' behaviors.

Briefly explain your well-commented codes & the overall
simulation in the provided text file, for your final answer
submission of this task. (P4)
==============================================================

>>> The task should take you around 45 to maximum 60 minutes
>>> to complete.

MARKS: 15 Marks
a. Source files (.py, .sim): 3 marks
b. First robot (LEFT): 2 marks
c. Second robot (RIGHT): 5 marks
d. Use of LiDAR sensors: 5 marks

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Change the files accordingly, settings & program scripts.
2. Write your personal details and SHORT EXPLANATION in the
   04-PersonalDetails-Explanation.txt file.
3. This is an individual task, NO forms of discussions (physical
   or online/phone/messaging) is allowed.
4. Please zip all the required files in a folder; name the folder
   & zip file as the example given, i.e. include your Section,
   Group, and matric number in the folder name & zip filename.

==============================================================
